* I can write R code that computes the average of a given set of values.

* I can write syntactically correct R statements.

* I could complete a programming project if someone showed me
how to solve the problem first

* I could complete a programming project if I could call someone for
help if I got stuck.

* I could complete a programming project once someone else helped
me get started.

* I could find ways of overcoming the problem if I got stuck at a point
while working on a programming project

I had written and make it work
