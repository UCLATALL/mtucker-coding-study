# Lesson Summary

We have some more coding activities that are even more challenging than the ones you just tried!

If you want to keep practicing, you can try more coding activities. You can do as many as you want, and at the very end, you can see the solutions.

Do you want to keep doing more coding activities? (If you choose no, the study will still continue.)
