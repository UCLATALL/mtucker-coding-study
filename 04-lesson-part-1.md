# Lesson: Part I

## Try Some R Coding

Here’s a bit of R (what we sometimes refer to as “code”). Read the code in the window below.  What do you think it will do? Click Run to see what happens.

Let's try another one.   Read the code and see if you can guess what it will do.  Then click Run to see what happens.

This bit of code printed out the sum of 1, 5, and 10 (that is, 16).

You can also use R like a basic calculator.  Try running this code to see how it works.

## R Functions

So far you know how to print some words and do some basic arithmetic in R. One of the great things about R is that there are a lot of built in commands that you can use. These are called functions. You have already seen two functions in action,  `print()`  and  `sum()` .

Functions have two basic parts. The first part is the name of the function (e.g., sum). The second part is the input to the function, which goes inside the parentheses. We call these inputs arguments.

Try running the `rflip()` function to see what it does. Then, try setting the `n =` argument to different values and see what happens.
