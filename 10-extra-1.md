# Extra Practice 1

Great work so far! The `filter()` function works similarly to the `arrange()` function, except that instead of supplying a data frame and a column argument, we supply a data frame and a condition.

For example, the condition `heart_rate < 80` means that each row of the data will only be kept if the heart rate recorded for that day was less than 80.

Try filtering `tracker` for days where we walked less than 10,000 feet.

Let's combine everything we've learned so far. Select the `heart_rate` variable from `tracker`. What do you notice about it?
