# Lesson: Part II 

Let’s keep learning some R skills! These examples are a bit trickier than the ones you just saw. 

## Example 3

R stores information in something called an object. Pretty much anything  can be saved in an R object. This is accomplished by using an assignment operator, which looks kind of like an arrow ( <- ).

Let’s make up a name for an R object; we will call it myfavoritenumber. Then let’s think of what our favorite number is (say, 20), and save it in the R object.

Go ahead and run the code below to see how this works.

In the example above, the first line of code creates the object, myfavoritenumber and stores the number 20 in that object. 

The second line of code prints the contents of the object in the console.  

### Practice #3

The code below runs an error. Modify the code so it works .
